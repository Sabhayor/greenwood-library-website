# Capstone Project: Enhancing the Greenwood Community Library Website

## Overview
In this Capstone Project, I worked on enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." The main goal was to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to showcase upcoming community events. This task helped me practice using Git, branching, and collaboration through pull requests, all while working with a simulated team setup.

## Objectives
My objectives were to:
- Enhance the website by adding the "Book Reviews" section and updating the "Events" page.
- Practice using Git workflows, including branching, staging, committing, and merging.
- Collaborate effectively with a teammate (simulated as Morgan and Jamie) to integrate changes smoothly.

## Setup and Initial Work

### Repository Creation
I began by setting up a GitHub repository named `greenwood-library-website` and cloned it to my local machine. I initialized it with a `README.md` file and created the basic website pages: `home.html`, `about_us.html`, `events.html`, and `contact_us.html`. These files had placeholder content, which I pushed to the main branch.

## My Tasks

### Morgan's Work: Adding the "Book Reviews" Section

#### Branch Creation
I created a branch called `add-book-reviews` to focus on the new "Book Reviews" section. I added a `book_reviews.html` file and populated it with some random content to simulate the reviews section.

#### Committing and Pushing
After making the changes, I staged and committed them with the message `Add book reviews section`, and pushed the branch to GitHub.

#### Creating and Merging the PR
I raised a pull request to merge the `add-book-reviews` branch into the main branch. Since there were no conflicts, I merged my changes into the main project.

### Jamie's Work: Updating the "Events" Page

#### Branch Creation
I created a branch named `update-events` to update the "Events" page with information about upcoming community events.

#### Pulling Latest Changes
Before making any updates, I pulled the latest changes from the main branch to ensure my work was in sync with Morgan’s changes.

#### Committing and Pushing
I made the necessary updates to the `events.html` page, staged the changes, and committed them with a clear message. After pushing the branch to GitHub, I created a pull request to merge the changes.

#### Merging the PR
My pull request was reviewed, and since there were no conflicts, I successfully merged the changes into the main branch.

## Git Workflow and Version Control
Throughout this project, I worked with several Git workflows:
- **Branching**: I created separate branches for my work, allowing me to focus on one feature at a time without interfering with my teammate’s progress.
- **Staging, Committing, and Pushing**: I regularly staged, committed, and pushed my changes to GitHub, keeping my progress up to date.
- **Pull Requests**: After pushing my changes, I created pull requests for review. This process ensured that my work was examined before being merged into the main branch.
- **Merging**: I ensured my branches were up to date and merged without issues.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Branching**: I learned the importance of working in branches to keep tasks separate and organized. This practice also allowed me to avoid conflicts with other contributors.
- **Collaboration**: The pull request process helped me understand how to review changes and work together on the same codebase without stepping on each other’s toes.
- **Version Control**: I got a solid understanding of how to manage code using Git, including how to pull the latest changes from the main branch to prevent conflicts.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project allowed me to enhance the Greenwood Community Library website while practicing Git and collaborative development. I successfully added a "Book Reviews" section and updated the "Events" page. The experience reinforced the importance of branching, regular commits, and using pull requests to work smoothly in a team.
